# pyCitePMID

Simple tool to exchange pmid's from raw text and exchange by numbering. 
Will create a bibliography. 
Current version does not conserve the format. 

Currently covered are: PMID<ID>; PMID:ID; PMID: ID; pmidID; pmid:ID, pmid: ID

Will work best if only a single style is set in the input text!
